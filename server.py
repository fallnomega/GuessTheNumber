# Final Project - Higher or Lower URLs Now it's time to complete the final project of the day, the higher lower game
# that we created in Day 14, but now with a real website.
#
# 1. Create a new project in PyCharm called higher-lower, add a server.py file.
#
# 2. Create a new Flask application where the home route displays an <h1> that says "Guess a number between 0 and 9"
# and display a gif of your choice from giphy.com.
#
# Alternatively use the one I found on Giphy: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCSPqXE5C6T8tBC/giphy.gif
